First, I created a baseline model using a `300k-row subset` with a speicific set of parameters. This initial model run served as a benchmark to measure how subsequent hyperparameter tuning would impact performance metrics such as RÂ², MAE, and RMSE.\n","\n","With XGBoost's computational efficiency (with each run on 300k rows taking at least 1.25 hours, but up to 2-4 times longer with complex parameters like higher iterations and increased depth), I was able to explore tuning across 8 different parameters.\n","\n","By systematically adjusting each parameter, I aimed to identify the best settings that would enhance the model's accuracy and minimize error rates."],"metadata":{"id":"u6IfSAgHvsCC"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":46304,"status":"ok","timestamp":1730107723694,"user":{"displayName":"Adithya R","userId":"06981244434554202327"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"O4Zdpj42Q-4L","outputId":"927f846a-f5d3-4bf3-8812-b8599a2300f0"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","tqdm is already installed.\n","\n","pyspark is NOT installed.
