First, I created a baseline model using a `600k row subset ` with a speicific set of parameters. This initial model run served as a benchmark to measure how subsequent hyperparameter tuning would impact performance metrics such as R², MAE, and RMSE.\n","\n","With Decision tree's computational efficiency (with each run on 600k rows taking at least 1.25 hours, but up to 2-4 times longer with complex parameters like higher no.of Bins and increased Depth, more min.number of bins), I was able to explore tuning across 8 different parameters.\n","\n","By systematically adjusting each parameter, I aimed to identify the best settings that would enhance the model's accuracy and minimize error rates."],"metadata":{"id":"dCYIpyk6xmpq"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":33828,"status":"ok","timestamp":1729818287449,"user":{"displayName":"Adithya R","userId":"06981244434554202327"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"2h7B1_FOX6En","outputId":"66a5a0e1-3c01-45f6-faf1-0d2e8bfd42e8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","tqdm is already installed.\n","\n","pyspark is NOT installed.
