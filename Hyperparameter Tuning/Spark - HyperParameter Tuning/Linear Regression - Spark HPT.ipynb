First, I created a baseline model using a 100k-row subset with basic parameters, giving me a reference point to measure how hyperparameter tuning impacted performance. Next, I experimented with different parameter settings on this 100k subset to identify the best configurations. Once I had the optimal parameters, I scaled up to the full 600k-row dataset to test how well these settings performed on a larger scale.\n","<br>\n","\n","This approach was necessary because a single run of `Linear Regression` was taking around 17 hours, making it impractical to tune all 8 parameters directly on the full dataset. By downsizing hyperparameter tuning to 100k rows, I could find the best parameters and then apply them to 600k rows for final testing."],"metadata":{"id":"FyRWLoL_DpeM"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":732,"status":"ok","timestamp":1729800265427,"user":{"displayName":"Adithya R","userId":"06981244434554202327"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"SzNOKsomYwKL","outputId":"991b9a13-254f-44f6-ed58-0518455fc680"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","tqdm is already installed.\n","\n","pyspark is already installed.\n","\n","gdown is already installed.\n","\n","numpy is already installed.\n"]}],"source":["import importlib\n","import subprocess\n","import sys\n","import gc\n","\n","def check_and_install_package(package_name, version=None):\n","    try:\n","        importlib.import_module(package_name)\n","        print(f\"\\n{package_name} is already installed.\")\n","    except ImportError:\n","        print(f\"\\n{package_name} is NOT installed.
